# Vaelum

Project Title:
Vaelum

Project Vision: 
The product will be for hardcore gamers that enjoy tightly constructed, fast paced, heavily
skill-based gameplay. As well as classic rhythm game fans who find the current structure of
rhythm games to be stale and over-saturated. Vaelum is a rhythm game that offers a new
gameplay alternative to the genre, in which the player must balance precision, timing and
information processing. It does this with gameplay that involves pressing the correct key to
highlight the right colour as well as controlling the cursor to click on the notes as they are
about to fade. This gives the game more complexity than most rhythm games and will
provide an interesting study as to how much complexity makes a game too obtuse to play.
