If you have played before, you can skip the tutorial with the 'Skip Tutorial' button on the main menu.

This demo concerns New Songs, Alternative Gamemodes and Gameplay Improvements.

Play at least one track and if possible play them all.

After beating a track, please remember the rating you get. 
If you do forget, don't worry as the rating is saved and displayed on the main menu.

Good luck!

To load up the game, open the folder called 'Vaelum Build' and double click the executable file called 'Vaelum' (it has its own logo).
